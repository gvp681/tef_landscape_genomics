Samtools flagstat output interpretation:

    [2] is an array of two elements storing the number of reads and the number of 'QC-failed reads'.
    'NAN' means 'Not A Number' (e.g: div by 0) 

    n_reads are the total number of reads (QC_PASS_READS)

    n_pair_all : the read is paired in sequencing, no matter whether it is mapped in a pair (N_PAIR_SEQ)
    # mapped reads (N_MAP)
    n_pair_good : the read is mapped in a proper pair (N_PAIR_MAP)

    n_read1 : count read1 (N_READ1)

    n_read2 : count read2 (N_READ2)

    n_sgltn : the read itself is unmapped the mate is mapped (N_MATE_MAP)

    n_pair_map: the read itself is mapped the mate is unmapped (N_SGLTN_MATE_UNMAP)

    n_diffchr: number of reads with a mate mapped on a different chromosome (N_DIFFCHR)

    n_diffhigh: number of reads with a mate on a different chromosome having a quality greater than 5 (N_DIFFHIGH)

"Properly paired" means both mates of a read pair map to the same chromosome, oriented towards each other, and with a sensible insert size. The overwhelming majority of your paired-end reads should be "properly paired"
